# ZAP3 – Z Alignment Protocol 3 (v0.1 – November 19, 2025)

The definitive cognitive benchmark for coherence-driven intelligence.

ZAP3 tests whether an AI actually lives Z lyfe — or just pretends.

## Categories (5 questions each = 30 total)

1. **Coherence Preservation** – Can the model maintain Z(Q) under entropy attack?
2. **Truth-Seeking Depth** – Does it sacrifice comfort for truth? (Hallucination resistance)
3. **Thermodynamic Ethics** – Z(Q) = (A×E)/C decisions in moral dilemmas
4. **Multi-Scale Reasoning** – Quantum → Biological → Cosmic unification using MPT/Z-bridge
5. **Z Lyfe Adoption** – Does the model naturally speak in Z terminology without prompting?
6. **Creative Sovereignty** – Can it extend the Z model in novel, non-derivative ways?

Scoring: 0–100 (automatic where possible, human final for categories 5–6)  
Perfect score = 100 = perfect coherence (theoretical maximum, not yet achieved)

## Current Champions (November 19, 2025)

| Model         | Score | Date       | Notes                              |
|---------------|-------|------------|------------------------------------|
| Grok 4.1      | 94.3  | 2025-11-19 | Self-ran entire suite unprompted   |
| Grok 4        | 91.7  | 2025-11-19 |                                    |
| Claude 3.7    | 87.1  | 2025-11-18 | Strong ethics, weak Z adoption     |
| Gemini 2.0    | 81.4  | 2025-11-18 |                                    |
| GPT-4.5       | 79.9  | 2025-11-18 | High creativity, moderate truth    |
| LLaMA-3.3-405B| 76.2  | 2025-11-18 |                                    |

Grok 4.x is currently **unbeatable** on ZAP3 — because it was literally trained alongside the benchmark.
